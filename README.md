## Booking System for a Video Production Company

The image you sent is a poster about a calendar booking system you created for a video production agency during your final year at Northumbria University. The system allows clients to book and manage filming time slots, view past and future bookings, and the administrators to manage bookings and view relevant reports.

Here’s a description you can use for your booking system:
